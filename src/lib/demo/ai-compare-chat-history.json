The Fabia is the practical city warrior—cheaper to run, easier to park, and still robust thanks to the proven 1.9 TDI block.",

Don’t mind spending extra on suspension and premium diesel\n  3. Appreciate classic executive styling and presence\n\n- Stick with the **Škoda** if you:\n  1. Spend most of your time in dense city traffic\n  2. Need predictable, low running costs and cheaper parts\n  3. Prefer a manual gearbox and easy parking\n\n**My neutral take:** Fabia is the sensible “use every day, forget about it” choice. The Mercedes becomes the right answer only if you specifically want rear-seat comfort or already budgeted for refurbishing an older executive sedan.",
