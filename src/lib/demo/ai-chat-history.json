      "content": "Common issues with the 2014 Volkswagen Golf 2.0 TDI (Mk7 generation):\n\n**Engine-related:**\n- DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) clogging, especially with city driving\n- EGR valve issues causing reduced performance\n- Turbocharger problems in some cases\n- Timing belt replacement critical around 120,000-150,000 km\n\n**Transmission:**\n- Manual gearbox is generally reliable, but check for smooth shifting\n- Clutch wear at this mileage is normal - verify when last replaced\n\n**Electrical:**\n- Some reports of infotainment system glitches\n- Electrical gremlins in rare cases\n\n**Body/Chassis:**\n- Check for rust, especially since it's imported (German cars may have different rust protection)\n- Suspension components may need attention at this age/mileage\n\n**Maintenance costs:**\n- Service intervals are important - verify all scheduled maintenance was done\n- Parts are readily available but can be expensive for genuine VW parts\n\nGiven the mileage and that it's imported, I'd strongly recommend a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with VW diesels.",
